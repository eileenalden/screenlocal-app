# URGENT: SCREENLOCAL DEMO SOLUTIONS

## OPTION 1: USE CURRENT WORKING URL (IMMEDIATE)
**FOR YOUR BUSINESS DEMO USE THIS URL:**
`https://oak-film-connect-eileenalden.replit.app`

✅ Fully functional ScreenLocal demo
✅ All features working (browse, AI search, early signup)
✅ Oakland branding and professional appearance
✅ Console export function: `exportEarlyUsers()`

## OPTION 2: DEPLOY TO VERCEL (15 minutes)
1. Run: `npx vercel login`
2. Run: `npx vercel --prod`
3. In Vercel dashboard, add domain screenlocal.app
4. Update DNS to point to Vercel

## OPTION 3: REPLIT DOMAIN RETRY
Try these alternatives in Replit:
- `www.screenlocal.app` 
- `demo.screenlocal.app`
- Cancel current setup and retry

## RECOMMENDATION FOR DEMO:
**Use the working Replit URL above** - it's identical to what screenlocal.app would show and saves deployment risk before your critical meeting.

After the demo, we can resolve the domain issue without pressure.
